📊 Power BI Project – Dirty Café Sales Dataset
🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on transforming a dirty café sales dataset from Kaggle into a clean, reliable, and insightful analytical dashboard using Power BI.
The dataset originally contained multiple data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent data types, invalid entries, and formatting errors. These issues were resolved through a comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing process before visualization.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following steps were applied to prepare the dataset for analysis:

Handling missing and null values

Removing invalid and erroneous records

Fixing inconsistent and incorrect entries

Standardizing data formats and units

Unifying data types across all columns

Ensuring overall data integrity and consistency

After cleaning, the dataset became analysis-ready and suitable for accurate reporting.

📈 Dashboard & Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard provides a clear and structured overview of café sales performance through multiple interactive visualizations:

Total Sales by Item (Bar Chart):
Displays total sales value for each item, allowing easy comparison between products.

Sales Percentage by Item (Donut Chart):
Shows the percentage contribution of each item to total sales, highlighting best-selling products.

Total Sales & Quantity KPIs (Cards):
Summarizes overall sales revenue and total quantity sold at a glance.

Sales vs Quantity by Item (Scatter Plot):
Analyzes the relationship between total sales and quantity sold for each item.

Item Filter (Slicer):
Enables interactive filtering to analyze individual items.
